## About the Video Course
The Elastic Stack is a powerful combination of tools for distributed search, analytics, logging, and the visualization of data from medium to massive datasets. The newly released Elastic Stack 6 brings new features and capabilities that empower users to find unique, actionable insights through these techniques. This course will give you a fundamental understanding of what the stack is all about, and how to use it efficiently to build powerful real-time data-processing applications. After a quick overview of the newly introduced features in Elastic Stack 6, you'll learn how to set up the stack by installing the tools, and explore their basic configurations. Then we demonstrates the creation of custom plugins using Kibana. We also provide useful tips on how to use the Elastic Cloud and deploy the Elastic Stack in production environments. After completing this course, you'll have a solid foundational knowledge of basic Elastic Stack functionalities. You'll also have a good understanding of the role each component in the stack plays to solve different data processing problems.
